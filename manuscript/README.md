## Generated-variable discipline

Manuscript source files should contain prose, cross-reference labels, and
`{{TOKEN}}` placeholders. Generated numbers, figure blocks, formalism rows,
claim-support summaries, evidence-tier summaries, and figure-quality summaries
come from `src/manuscript_variables.py` and `output/data/manuscript_variables.json`.

Do not hard-code figure numbers, equation numbers, table numbers, generated
counts, support rates, evidence fact counts, or figure-quality totals in
manuscript prose. Use `[@fig:...]`, `[@eq:...]`, `[@tbl:...]`, and generated
variables so prerender, registry, evidence, and citation gates can detect drift.

## Visual QA text

Results and reproducibility sections intentionally describe
`output/reports/figure_quality_report.json`. That report is generated from
source-owned figure specs and records PNG/SVG presence, dimensions, nonblank
pixel checks, color variance, and registry parity. If a fork changes figures,
update the `src/figures/` package, regenerate Stage 02, and let the manuscript consume
the refreshed variables rather than editing rendered Markdown.
