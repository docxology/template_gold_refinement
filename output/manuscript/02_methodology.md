# Methodology: The Refinery Pipeline {#sec:methodology}

The refinery pipeline consists of 5 canonical stages, each mapping a metallurgical operation to a manuscript-composition operation. The pipeline is implemented in `src/refinery.py` and validated by `src/purity.py`.

## Stage definitions

| # | Stage | Output purity | Karat | Metallurgical operation |
|---|-------|-------------|-------|------------------------|
| 1 | ore | 37.50% | 9K | Extract raw gold-bearing ore from the earth |
| 2 | smelting | 75.00% | 18K | Heat ore to separate gold from slag and dross |
| 3 | assaying | 91.67% | 22K | Test a sample to determine gold content and impurities |
| 4 | cupellation | 99.900% | 24K | Refine by blowing air through molten lead-gold alloy |
| 5 | certification | 99.9999999% (nine-nines) | 24K (nine-nines certified) | Certify purity grade and stamp hallmark |

## Purity progression

The purity sequence across all stages is: 0.100000, 0.375000, 0.750000, 0.916700, 0.999000, 1.000000

Purity is strictly increasing — enforced by `assert_monotone_increase()` which raises `ValueError` if any stage's output purity does not exceed its input. Formally, for stages $s_1, \ldots, s_n$ with input purity $p_{\text{in}}^{(i)}$ and output purity $p_{\text{out}}^{(i)}$:

$$
p_{\text{out}}^{(i)} > p_{\text{in}}^{(i)} \quad \text{and} \quad p_{\text{in}}^{(i+1)} = p_{\text{out}}^{(i)} \quad \forall i \in \{1, \ldots, n-1\}
$$

The full purity progression is shown in [@fig:purity_progression] (see [@sec:results]).

## Token selection

The mega-madlib engine selects tokens from config-owned lexicon categories using a deterministic digest:

$$
\text{index} = \text{int}\left(\text{SHA-256}\left(\text{seed} \mid \text{slot} \mid \text{category} \mid \text{ordinal} \mid \text{inventory}\right)[:12], 16\right) \mod n
$$

where $n$ is the size of the lexicon category inventory. Selected metallurgical terms: hallmark, cupellation, assaying. Selected manuscript terms: evidence, evidence.

## Config-owned lexicon

| Category | Count | Sample |
|----------|-------|--------|
| manuscript_terms | 5 | draft, claim, citation... |
| metallurgical_terms | 5 | cupellation, assaying, smelting... |
| purity_adjectives | 5 | unrefined, purified, certified... |
| refinement_verbs | 5 | assaying, certifying, refining... |

## Karat grading

Karat grades map purity fractions to standard gold fineness:

- 9K = 37.5% (ore stage)
- 18K = 75.0% (smelting stage)
- 22K = 91.67% (assaying stage)
- 24K = 99.9% (cupellation stage)
- Nine-nines = 99.9999999% (certification stage)

The mapping is implemented in `src/purity.py::karat_for_purity()`. The karat grading chart is shown in [@fig:karat_grading] (see [@sec:results]).

## Pipeline phases

| Phase | Input | Transformation | Output | Guard |
|-------|-------|----------------|--------|-------|
| Schema intake | manuscript/config.yaml | Load and validate gold_refinement block | GoldRefinementConfig | config schema tests |
| Refinery execution | GoldRefinementConfig | Run five refinery stages with monotone purity | RefineryResult | monotone purity test |
| Token planning | GoldRefinementConfig | Expand slots into deterministic token choices | TokenPlan | seed-stability tests |
| Figure generation | RefineryResult and TokenPlan | Generate purity progression, karat grading, and token density figures | output/figures/*.png | nonblank figure tests |
| Manuscript hydration | manuscript shells and manuscript_variables.json | Resolve {{TOKEN}} placeholders into output/manuscript/ | hydrated Markdown manuscript | unresolved-token scan |
| Render and validate | output/manuscript | Render PDF, HTML through shared template pipeline | output/pdf and output/web | render command |
